**No Bees Today** is an app for people who use birth control pills. The app reminds the user to take their pills at an adjusted time and keeps calling them to take the pill until they made it.

Also **No Bees Today** runs totally offline and saves all the user data into a local storage at the specific phone. No cloud storage or any connection to a server is used. In my opinion it's important to have access to apps in the medical sector which **not** give away your medical data to any kind of service or device you are not owning.

## Status

This project is still in a early beta stage. Neither the design nor the usability or the scope of functions are already finalized. Just the underlying concept of storing objects and the algorithm to calculate a cycle and access persistent informations from every place in the programm is already nearly finished.

## Roadmap

Take a look at the [issue](https://github.com/Mo0812/nobeestoday2/issues) settings!

## Contribution

I currently develop this app on my own, but everyone is welcome to contribute some code or changes! 

For everyone who wants to test the latest development status:
* clone and build the app on your own *or*
* send me a **direct message** with **your name** and **your email adress** at [@Mo0812](https://twitter.com/Mo0812) to join on **Testflight**.

## Goals for building this app

* Gaining more experience in building an iOS app from scratch up to the App Store
* Help to build an alternative for existing pill-reminding-apps with focus on owning your own medical data
* Have a playground to testing new technologies
* Build an solid open source app for a real world scenario
