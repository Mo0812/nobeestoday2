# No Bees Today

**No Bees Today** is an app for people who use birth control pills. The app reminds the user to take their pills at an adjusted time and keeps calling them to take the pill until they made it.

Also **No Bees Today** runs totally offline and saves all the user data into a local storage at the specific phone. No cloud or anything to match.

## Status

This project is still in a early pre-beta stage. Neither the design nor the usability or the scope of functions are already finalized. Just the underlying concept of storing objects and the algorithm to calculate a cycle and access persistent informations from every place in the programm is already nearly finished.

## Roadmap

More details coming soon.
