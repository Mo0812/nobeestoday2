# No Bees Today

**No Bees Today** is an app for people who use birth control pills. The app reminds the user to take their pills at an adjusted time and keeps calling them to take the pill until they made it. Also No Bees Today runs totally offline and saves all the user data into a local storage at the specific phone. No cloud or anything to match.
